LogcatDisplay
==========

Displaying logcat messages in an app; a simple example

This activity demonstrates how to capture and display Android logcat messages from within an appâ€¦ for the debugger-on-the-go

Intended for use on Android 4.3+, which means that the read_logs permission is not required and that the app can only capture its own logs: http://stackoverflow.com/a/16795874
